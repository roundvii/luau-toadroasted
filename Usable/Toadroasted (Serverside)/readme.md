Deletes every model in the workspace except for player characters, turns players into Toad, spams a message saying "Get toadroasted you bacon haired bozos!", turns the skybox into Toad, creates falling Toads out of the sky and plays loud noises. You can spam this to lag the entire game out to a point of unplayability.

**PLEASE NOTE** this is a **RECREATION** of Toadroasted. This is not 1:1 and has my own features. If you think I am a skid for this, you might just be a little slow in the head.
