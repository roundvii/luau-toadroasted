# Thanks for visiting

This repository contains Luau scripts that I have created myself over time. Have fun with them I guess.

To execute scripts, **use the Loader.lua file to load the script.** If you don't, the script *will not* auto-update when I fix bugs and add new features, which is absolutely lame.

**Most of these scripts are server-side only.** I recommend a game like [Client Replication](https://www.roblox.com/games/10218821851/Client-Replication) that will let you execute these scripts properly so other players can experience the same effects. I will also make some that work on the client-side.
