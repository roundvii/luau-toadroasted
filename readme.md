# Thanks for visiting

This repository contains Luau scripts that I have created myself over time. Have fun with them I guess.

To execute scripts, **use the Loader.lua file to load the script.** If you don't, the script *will not* auto-update when I fix bugs and add new features, which is absolutely lame.
